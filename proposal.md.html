### Speech Interface

This component is responsible for parsing verbal speech into text and text back 
into verbal speech. This will include managing the connection to the 
microphone/speaker and anything else needed. Think of it like a black box where 
verbal speech goes in text comes out and text goes in verbal speech comes out.

**Tools that might be relevant**

- aplay
- vosk
- speech-recognizer
- arecord


### Assistant

This is the intelligence of the system, but it need only be intelligent enough 
match a request with a description of action. There are a few things the 
assistant should be capable of. 

1. It should be able to hold a semi decent conversation
2. It should be able to identify requests/commands and match that 
    request/command against a list of possible actions (each action has a 
    description of itself)

If the input to the assistant is something that can be solved with a known 
action, then trigger the action (External Script). If not then just respond like
its a conversation.

### External Scripts

These are scripts that do things. They could be python, bash, perl, lua, 
anything as long as its triggerable with a cli call. They have a natural 
language description of what the script does. When the Assistant needs to do 
something it uses this description to determine whether this script will do what
is needed. If it will it will trigger this script.

### Visual Interface

Speech is slow and has a low bandwidth. Visuals are faster and can communicate a 
lot more in a smaller package.

visual interface will be the systems means of 
[backchannel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backchannel_(linguistics) 
communication. The visual interface should fill in the gap for when a user might go "Is this 
thing working"

    <summary>I have a few thoughts this topic but I'd rather y'all get a chance
        to think on this before being influenced by my thoughts

    - The system hosts a live reloading site that showcases the current state of 
        the system. Anyone visiting the site can see the current state of the 
        system.
    - Condense the state of the system into a json and make it available 
        at an endpoint. (REST/Websocket/Anything). Then we can make 
        any sort of front end freely and independently. 
            - App that sends push notifications on phone
            - PC utils that show status in task bar notifications
            - Hardware component that lights up LEDs to indicate status

External Scripts
================
These are some script that I think would be cool to have.

Play Spotify
------------
We should have a few scripts that control a spotify session using the 
[spotify api](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api). 

Similarly we should also have a script to control a media player playing local 
mp3s. 

Leave the house reminder
------------------------
A script that uses google navigation api to remind you to leave the house at the 
right time to get get where you want on time.

Open applications
-----------------
- Scripts to open applications on your computer/phone/smart tv.
- Scripts to initiate calls on your phone

Summary Scripts
---------------
Scripts to summarize emails/discord messages etc.
